Resque
======

We have the following queues:

viz
---

This queue is read by the Java app (Jesque... class) to read a render request from the front-end.

push_to_web
-----------

When the render request is completed, the Java backend willll push a new job to the `push_to_web`
queue which the front-end uses to asynchronously notify the web client.


EventSource HQ (ESHQ)
=====================

This is a Heroku add-on service implementing "Server-Side Events", an HTML5 technology for pushing data from
the sever to the client. It's a lighter-weight technology than Websockets, but it doesn't support bi-directional
communication. To run the app locally with this in place, you need to set the ESHQ environment veriables,
`ESHQ_KEY`, `ESHQ_SECRET` and `ESHQ_URL` which can be found from `heroku config`.
