    profile_authenticity:
      title: Profile Authenticity
      content:
        (0...100)
        The Authenticity Score tells us how much effort the user has invested into
        their profile over time. Variables that enter here include the number of friends,
        age of the profile. Higher scores here imply a greater relevance and
        confidence of the other scores.
    trust_score:
      title: Trust Score
      content:
        (0...100)
        The Trust Score is a measure of the real-world social engagement of the user
        with their community.

      content: Coming soon...
    inbound_engagement_index:
      title: Inbound Engagement Index
      content:
        (1...100) Shows the amount of inbound communication such as likes,
        co-tagged photos, or comments. This is important, because it illustrates
        that the user is a respected member of their community and his/her friends
        are engaging with him/her. In particular third-party checkins or co-tagged
        photos confirm that a user met with a member of his/her community in the real
        world, therby providing an offline confirmation of the relationship.
    outbound_engagement_index:
      title: Outbound Engagement Index
      content:
        (1...100) Shows the amount of outbound communication originated by the user.
        A high number here is not unambigously positive, because it could indicate
        spamming activity with little real engagement with the community. If this is
        balanced with a high amount of inbound activity, i.e. a close to even ratio
        between both, then this is a very positive sign of an actively engaged user
        with his/her friends.
    engagement_ratio:
      title: Engagement Ratio
      content:
        (1...100) The ratio between inbound and outbound engagements. A number close to
        unity is a highly reputable value. A very large number could indicate a spammer,
        a very small number could indicate an inactive profile.
